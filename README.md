# Simple_Web_Shop_Using_ASP.NET

## PajoPhone
A simple web app project using ASP.NET.

## Overview
This is a practical interview question assigned to me at [IAIS](https://iais.ir/). I chose the MVC architecture to develop some kind of online Phone-shop (later, it may become an online shop for any kind of product). I'm leveraging the ASP.NET framework to learn C# and the framework alongside developing. I should note that this is nothing useful but a tutorial kind of project.

## Step-by-Step TODOs
You can see what I've supposed to do and what I've done in the section below:

### Main Tasks

1. [x] **Pre-requisite: learning the basics and setting up the environment**
    - [x] Learning the basics of C#:
        - Fortunately, I was familiar with Java and C. So there was nothing hard for me to struggle with. I used the [Microsoft documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/tour-of-csharp/) for learning C#. I didn't go too deep since I found there's no limit to getting exact and deep. Hopefully, I'll read that deeply someday when I have the time or need to.
    - [x] Setting up the development environment: FUCK WINDOWS
        - As advised by my supervisor, since we need to use SQL Server, it was a good idea to start learning on Windows OS. As a good intern, I tried to follow his advice and started my work on Windows, installing .NET 8, ASP, Rider IDE, etc. It wasn't very bad at first, but when I tried to do some development on the project, I found it near impossible. How am I supposed to do well when there isn't even a good terminal for me? So I did my best, but no, there was no way I could get along with it and do well on Windows. So, as any human being with minimum IQ would do in this situation, I switched to Linux (Ubuntu, as I said, with minimum IQ), and here I am! Got rid of all the shitty Windows troubles. LONG LIVE OPEN SOFTWARE!
        - Installed .NET, ASP, Rider on Ubuntu, and checked everything is OK. I added a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/saamTheSoldier/Simple_Web_Shop_Using_ASP.NET) too. If you can't find it, maybe it's still private.
    - [x] Diving into ASP development:
        - First thing first, the Microsoft MVC web app using ASP.NET documentation is my main source of elementary learning. [Check it out](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/tutorials/first-mvc-app/start-mvc?view=aspnetcore-8.0&tabs=visual-studio).

2. [ ] **Phase 1: Implement the main structure of the online shop**
    - [x] Playing with the template:
        - As I always say, playing with existing structures and messing around with things as amusement is the best way to learn (at least for me). Like when you've learned some mathematical concept, and to become more expert, there is no better way than thinking and solving many related problems. Same thing here. Time to do something real :))
    - [ ] Adding Admin panel
        - [ ] Add Phone model
        - [ ] Add view-models for the list page, edit, and create pages
        - [ ] Add Controller for the admin page
    - [ ] Implementing Customer side
        - [ ] Implement the basic structure for the shop page
        - [ ] Add filter options and a search bar maybe?

3. [ ] **Phase 2: Make the web app more general**
    - [ ] Design the features and complete this file :_))
